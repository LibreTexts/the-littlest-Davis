# the-littlest-Davis

This repository contains our work on customization options for 
[The Littlest JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub).
The script `setup.sh` is still in development and may not completely work. 
The script intends to install nbgrader and include more options in the future.

## Testing
First, install The Littlest JupyterHub following the 
[documentation's instructions](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/custom-server.html).
Then, run `setup.sh`.
